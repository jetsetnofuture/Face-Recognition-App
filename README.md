# Recognize the Face

## What Does It Do
* Recognize The Face is an app that detects the face of a person in an image
* The user uploads an image and the Clarifai API determines where the face is and the app puts a box around it

## Motivation
* To become familiar with incorporating outside APIs that use AI like Clarifai
* To build an app with multiple complex features (image upload and facial recognition)

## Stack
* React
* Clarifai API
* Express
* Node
