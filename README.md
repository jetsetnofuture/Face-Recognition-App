# Face Recognition App

## What Does It Do
* An app that detects the face of a person in an image
* The user uploads an image and the Clarifai API determines where the face is and the app puts a box around it

## Why Did I Make It
* To become familiar with incorporating outside APIs that use AI like Clarifai
* To build an app with multiple complex features (image upload and facial recognition)

## Tech I Used
* JavaScript
* React
* Clarifai API
* Express
* Node
